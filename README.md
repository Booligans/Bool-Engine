# Bool-Engine

Simple game engine with heavy reliance on the Allegro library. Capable of powering simple 2D games, as illustrated by the [PacMan](https://github.com/Booligans/PacMan) repository.

## Concept

The aim of this game is to recreate the classic Pac-Man, as well as to provide a simple way to create new levels and illustrate basic encryption/decryption protocols and AI behavior.

## Playing

To play this game, it is required to download a set of folders containing the sprites. You can download them [here](pending-link)
